What is Machine Learning

Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly
programmed.


Why Machine Learning

Many programs can’t be hardcoded.For example Autonomous helicopter,handwriting
recognition, most of Natural Language Processing
(NLP), Computer Vision etc.
User based recommendations can’t be done without machine learning.As
each user requires a different program,it is not quite possible
to write so many programs for so many people.Ex Amazon,Netflix etc
